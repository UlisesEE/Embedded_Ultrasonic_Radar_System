# Embedded_Ultrasonic_Radar_System
An Arduino-based ultrasonic radar system with real-time object detection and visualization. The project integrates an ultrasonic sensor with Arduino IDE (C++) for distance measurement and a Processing IDE (Java) GUI for live radar-style display. Demonstrates embedded systems design, hardware-software integration, and real-time signal processing.
